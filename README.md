# Terminal
This is a work  I did at school, it create a linux terminal and will display and record all the response icluding failed ones.

It has the following function: input different command line and display the result from linux end. Record the history linux commnad, its response and exit code. 

It also has the number mark in front of each history. I designed and developed the UI completely on my own.
